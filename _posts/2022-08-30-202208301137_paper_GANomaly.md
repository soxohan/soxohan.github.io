## Goal

- Introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space
  - 이미지를 생성하는 과정과 latent space를 학습하는 과정을 한 번에 진행.

## Methods

- Objective : train an unsupervised network that detects anomalies using a dataset that is highly biased towards a particular class - i.e., comprising normal non-anomalous occurrences only for training
- 3 sub-networks
  - Bow tie autoencoder network
  - Encoder network E
    - compresses the image x hat that is reconstructed by the network G
  - Discriminator network D
    - classify the input x and the output x hat as real or fake
- loss functions
  - Adversarial Loss : x와 만들어진 G(x)가 discriminator network에서 나온 intermediate feature 상에서 L2로 같도록.
  - Contextual Loss : G(x)와 원본 이미지 x가 L1으로 같도록.
  - Encoder Loss : latent vector들 간의 비교.
