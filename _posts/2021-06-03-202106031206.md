### Transfer Learning

이전 task에서 학습된 features와 weights 등을 이와 **비슷한 새로운 task에 적용**하는 방법

<br>

### Domain Adaptation

데이터의 도메인을 이동함으로써 이전에 학습한 네트워크를 사용하는 방법

> Domain shift refers to the situation where source and target problems **share the same objective**, but the input distribution of the target task is shifted with respect to the source task, reducing model performance
>
> DA is a variant of transfer learning that attempts to alleviate this issue byadapting the source-trained model using sparse or unlabeled data from the target. DG refers to methods to train a source model to be robust to such domain-shift without further adaptation. Many knowledge transfer methods have been studied, to boost target domain performance. However,  as for TL, vanilla DA and DG don't use a meta-objective to optimize 'how to learn' across domains. Mean while, meta-learning methods can be used to perform both DA and DG

> Domain adaptation is a type of transfer learning in which **the source/target tasks are the same** but the **source/target domains are different**. 

> Transfer learning methods are popularly used in FSL, where the prior knowledge is transferred from the source task to the few-shot task.

**Domain Adaptation**

: target의 sparse, unlabeled data를 사용해서 source-trained model을 adapting 시키고자 하는 transfer learning의 변형

**Domain Generalization**

: 추가적인 adaptation 없이 domain-shift를 robust하도록 source model을 train시키는 방법

### Few Shot 

적은 양의 데이터로 모델을 학습하여 테스트 데이터에서 유의미한 성능을 얻고자 하는 작업

예측하고자 하는 클래스, 소수 데이터, 다수 데이터가 서로 다르다

이렇게 과업으로 나누어 학습하는 방법

BCI의 두 가지 유형의 generalization problem

- **Session-to-Session**
  The EEG signals of different sessions show consistency, while there are still differences. 
  EEG has nonstationary characteristic, and <u>we can view every session a slightly new task.</u>
- **Subject-to-subject**
  EEG signals are subject-specific and vary considerably between individuals.
  However, the collection of the training data appears to be time consuming and expensive when there is a need to quickly build a reliable model to track a new user’s affective states.
