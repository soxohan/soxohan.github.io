~~간단한데 효과가 좋은~~

## Goal

- Propose a simple yet effective normalization method called reversibleinstance noralization (RevIN)
- Normalization-and-denormalization method with learnable affine transformation

### Problem

- normalization
  - It can prevent the model from capturing the original data distribution
  - It removes non-stationary information that can be important

<br>

## Methods

- To alleviate the distribution shift problem in time-series
  - to cause a substantial discrepancy between the training and test data distributions
- instance의 mean, variance → normalize
- However, the input data have different statistics thatn the original distribution, and by observing only the normalized input, it is difficulst to capture the original distribution of the input.
- Denormalize the model output by applying the reciprocal of the normalization
- RevIN is most effective when applied to <u>virtually symmetric layers</u> of encoder-decoder structure

## Results

- The result supports that the original multimoal distributions are caused by discrepancies in distributions between different sequences in the data
- RevIN의 정규화 단계가 distribution shift problem을 완화하여, train과 test data 간의 분포 불일치를 줄일 수 있음
