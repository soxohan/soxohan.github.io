## Goal

Facilitations of the fast deployment of emotion recognition models by reducing the reliance on the labeled data amount which has practical significance

<br>

<br>

## Motivations

- Hope of acquire models for new persons as fast as possible
- Reduction of the demand for the labeled for the labeled data amount

<br>

<br>

## Methods and materials

- SEED data
  - 15 Chinese film clips (each clip lasted about 4min)
  - 64-channel EEG data 15 subjects
  - 15 sessions
- Source selection
  - Enumeration of the classifiers in the sources to classify labeled target data
  - Locate the top N classifiers with high accuracies
- Style Transfer Mapping (STM)
  - Mapping of data from origin to destination via an affine mapping
- Mapping origin and destination
  - Train binary SVM between each pair of emotions
  - Use of one-to-one voting strategy for SVM combination
  - Removal of the SVs which are the nearest samples from the decision boundaries
- Two possible algorithms
  - **Supervised method**
    - Only use of the labeled target data of the calibration sessions
      - No need to set confidence
  - **Semi-supervised method**
    - Use of both labeled target data and the unlabeled target data

<br>

<br>

## Results and discussion

- Semi-supervised method achieves 91.31%
  - By absorbing the additional information of the test data
- Using multiple sources is more favorable than using a unified source
- The SVs removal enhances the mean accuracies
- Results
  - For the positive emotion, STM makes the activations of the target closer to temporal electrodes
  - For the neutral emotion, there are no visible differences
  - For the negative emotion, STM moves the activation patterns to the frontal electrodes

## Limitations

- Lacks of the explanations from the perspective of neurophysiology
  - Because of focus on the machine learning methods
- Lack of the number of categories in this paper
