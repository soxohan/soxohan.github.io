## Abstract

- Propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic
  - it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems

<br>

<br>

## Introduction

**key idea**

To train the model's initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated through one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of data from that new task



<br>

### Contributions

- a simple modeland task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning 
  - trains a model’s parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to fast learning on a new task.
