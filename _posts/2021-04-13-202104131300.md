## 1st BCI team seminar presentation

#### Introduction

- Goal
  - Use of the Self-Organizing Neural Fuzzy Inference Network (SONFIN) to estimate a driver's  /passenger's sickness level based on EEG features
    - Extracted online from five motion sickness-related brain areas
    - Left & Right motors, parietal, lateral occipital, and occipital midline brain areas
- Contribution
  - **The first paper to predict Motion Sickness Level (MSL) in an online environment**

<br>

#### Methods

- Experimental settings
  - VR-based dynamic driving simulator
    - Providing both visual and vestibular stimuli
    - Continuous report sickness level using a joystick with a scale that ranged from 0 to 65,535
  - Three-section motion sickness experimental protocol
    - 10-min baseline section, 40-min winding road section, and 15-min rest section
- Data acquisition and processing
  - 32-channel EEG data from 17 healthy right-handed volunteers
  - 32-bit quantization at a sampling rate of 500 Hz
  - Down-sampling to 250 Hz and filtering with a high- and low-pass filters
  - Application of  ICA to solve the BSS problem
- Feature extraction and selection
  - Using component clustering
  - Frequency band selection
  - Use of PCA as an optional feature selector
- Analysis method used in the study
  - Frequency band time-frequency analysis
    - determining the latency
      - ​	Between the specific frequency band of the EEG dynamics and MSL by changing the time lag
    - Calculating the CCs
- MSL prediction models
  - SONFIN
    - A general connectionist model of a fuzzy logic system
    - Finding optimal structure and parameters automatically
  - Linear Regression (LR)
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Smoother
    - Using a moving average to suppress fluctuation caused by time discontinuity
- Performance estimation
  - Pearson product-moment correlation-coefficient
  - Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)
- Evaluation method
  - 70 % (training set) and 30 % (test set)
    - 20 times repetitions

<br>

#### Results

- The highst performance with the SONFIN compared to LR and SVR
- Increase of system performance when using the PCA
- High correlation of the broadband EEG power responses in the occipital midline brain area and subjective sickness levels
- Valid indicators of motion sickness using the alpha and gamma bands of the EEG power spectrum

<br>

#### Discussion

- Extracting important components by using PCA
- Use of linear transformation of input variables

<br>

#### Conclusions

- Limitations
  - No evaluation of the system performance in terms of RMSE
    - Because of the lack of a method for standardizing and quantifying each subject's motion sickness
  - Absence of results related to the ICA
- Future work
  - Focusing on enhance the system's performance by finding a method for extracting perfect motion sickness indicators from a neural network
