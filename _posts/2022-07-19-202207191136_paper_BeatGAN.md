## Goal

- Propose BeatGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for time series data
  - Detects anomalies using adversarially generated time series

### Problem

How can we automatically detect anomalous beats when monitoring multivariate time series?

Can we pinpoint the anomalous time ticks that led to our decision?

- Massive time series can contain few anomalies, which is insufficient and imbalanced for supervised classificaton 
- Anomalous segments can be very different from one another
- Even in healthy patients, the time periods involved in various heartbeat characteristics vary from one beat to another
