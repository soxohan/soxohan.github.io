## Introduction

### Study the problem of AL under a domain shift (Active Domain Adaptation)

- Goal : to select target instances for labeling and learn a model with high accuracy on the target test set

<br>

### Propose Clustering Uncertainty-weighted Embeddings (CLUE)

- AADA(the state-of-the-art Active DA method) 
  - Combines uncertainty with diversity measured by “targetness” under a learned domain discriminator
  - Targetness does not ensure that the selected instances are representative if the entire target data distribution or dissimilar to one another
- Combines uncertainty and diversity sampling in a principled manner without the need for complex 
   gradient or domain discriminator-based diversity measures
- Identifies informative and representative target instances from dense regions of the feature space

<br>

<br>

## Methods

- Predictive entropy
  - To measure informativeness

- Implicit domain classifier

- To jointly capture both diversity and uncertainty
  - Propose weighting samples based on their uncertainty and compute the weighted population variance

- Trading-off uncertainty and diversity
  - Captures an implicit trade-off between model uncertainty (via entropy-weighting) and feature-space coverage (via clustering)
  - T : temperature
    - T ↑ : expect diversity to play a bigger role
    - T ↓ : expect uncertainty to play a bigger role
