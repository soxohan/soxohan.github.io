S. Lee, S. Kim, H. G. Kim, and Y. M. Ro, “Assessing Individual VR Sickness through Deep Feature Fusion of VR Video and Physiological Response,” *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, 2021, pp. 1-13.

~~오랜만에 랩미팅에서 발표한 논문. 생각보다 이해도 쉽고 잘 써서 참고할 만하다고 생각되었다!~~

## Goal

- To estimate individual VR sickness through the fusion of accessible information related to VR sickness
  - Individuals experiencing same VR video can feel different levels of VR sickness

<br>

## Methods

- Content stimulus guider
  - To reflect VR sickness caused by VR videos based on the neural mismatch theory
  - Sensory mismatch detector and stimulus context extractor
- Physiological response guider
  - EEG, ECG, and GSR sickness feature extractors
  - To reflect individual deviations of VR sickness according to the physiological characteristics of human responses
- VR sickness guider
  - To combines the deep stimulus feature with the deep physiology feature to predict individual SSQ scores

## Result

- The proposed fusion of multiple  physiological responses predicts VR sickness more effectively
