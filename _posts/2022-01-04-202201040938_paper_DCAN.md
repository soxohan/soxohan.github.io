## Goal
- To simultaneously learn domain-specific features in convolutional stage and effectively mitigate the domain mismatch in task-specific layers
  - Propose a domain conditioned adaptation network (DCAN) for unsupervised visual domain adaptation 

<br>

## Materials and methods
- Domain conditioned convolutional learning
  - A domain conditioned channel attention mechanism
    - To effectively capture domain-specific information in low-level stage
    - The possibility of modeling the independencies between the convolutional channels for source and target respectively
- Task-specific feature alignment via domain conditioned feature correction
  - To enable adapting source discriminative knowledge to target at high-level stage
  - Adapt all the layers corresponding to task-specific features layer-wisely

## Results

- DCAN shows greater ability of making inter-class separated and intra-class clustered
- DCAN can facilitate learning domain-specific convolutional features by increasing the sensitivity to informative channels and suppressing the useless ones
- The attention difference of the first three stages is obviously smaller than that of the stage 4
  - The source and target networks extract more general low-level features in the early stages of 
     convolutional layers
  - Completely sharing convolutional layers across two domains might be improper
