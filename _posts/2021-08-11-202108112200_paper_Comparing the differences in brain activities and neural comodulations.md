- Goal 
  - Exploring differences in brain dynamics that accompany fluctuations in the level of Motion Sickness in drivers and passengers in a realistic driving task

<br>

- Motivations
  - No study has compared passengers and drivers' neural activities and drivers experiencing motion sickness

<br>

- Methods and materials
  - Experimental settings
    - VR-based motion sickness platform
      - Providing both visual and vestibular stimuli
      - Continuously reported the degree of motion sickness with a wireless device
        - Ranging from zero to nine
    - Three-section motion sickness experimental protocol
      - 5-min baseline section
      - 40-min motion sickness section 
      - 5-min recovery section
      - Tested twice and took turns as passengers or drivers
  - Data acquisition and preprocessing
    - 64-channel EEG data from 18 pairs of yoked participants
    - Applying ICA to separate independent brain components from the high-density EEG data
  - Time-frequency analysis
    - Seven independent components were selected
  - Independent modulator decomposition
    - Temporally independent and fixed spectrally Independent Modulators (IM)
      - Offering a comprehensive picture of the neurological processes that define the overt behavioral responses

<br>

- Results
  - Passengers have significantly greater overall spectral power as compared to the drivers
    - Passengers are more susceptible to motion sickness than drivers
  - The alpha band spectral power increases as the motion sickness level rises

<br>

- Discussion
  - Alpha suppression in the left motor, right motor, parietal, and occipital midline components
  - Sensory processing is reflected in the alpha activity
  - Alpha modulation could be an indicator of motion sickness to help regulate the dynamic activity of the cortex

<br>

- Limitations
  - Conducting the motion sickness experiment as the driver and passenger on different days
  - Need for more relevant factors
    - Such as each subject's driving experience and habits
