## Abstract

**NEED**

stress levels of drivers can be detected in real time with high accuracy so that intervening or navigating measures can be taken in time to mitigate the situation

**PROPOSED**

a framework of driver stress detection through multimodal fusion using attention based deep learning techniques

<br>

<br>

## Introduction

two types of stress

- eustress
  - positive correlation with life satisfaction
- distress
  - opposite mental state

<br>

이 논문에서는, stress가 부정적인 의미로 쓰임!!

stress가 driver crash에 영향을 주므로......

It is essential to build a system which can detect drivers' stress levels accurately.

<br>

the use of multimodal data can substantially improve driver stress classification performance

<br>

strategies for fusion

- sensor-level
- feature-level
  uses handcrafted features or deep learning features to build multimodal models
  - deep learning methods can automatically extract features without expertise
- decision-level

<br>

To effectively fuse features from different modalities, attention mechanism is introduced in this paper to integrate eye data, vehicle data and environmental data.

attention mechanism

- can reduce the dependence on external data
- capture the internal relationship of longer data or features

self-attention 

- can be used to process the hidden states of an LSTM or Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) for classification tasks

<br>

**proposed model...**

- first, uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to extract features

- allocates different levels of attention to features with different modalities using a self-attention mechanism

→ can capture the relationship between multimodal data and driver stress levels

### Contributions

- A framework based on attentional CNN-LSTM network is proposed to build an accurate driver stress detection system. This attention-based multimodal fusion model can not only automatically extract features but also weigh the features from different modalities to improve performance on driver stress level classification.
- A non-invasive multimodal data combination is proposed for driver stress detection, which includes eye data, vehicle dynamics data and environmental data. The non-invasive characteristics makes it more suitable for practical deployment.
- Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed model. Experimental results show that eye data is a promising data for driver stress detection and attention-based multimodal fusion model is superior to other non-attention models.

**feature-level fusion method**

Most of the studies fuse multimodal data at feature-level. 

→ combines feature data from each modality into a feature vector, which is fed into a classifier.

However,

this approach lacks the ability to handle complex multimodal and high dimensional data

→→ To improve the model's robustness and data processing ability, deep learning techniques are used to process multimodal data

```
Deep learning techniques can directly process the original data and are widely used in high dimensional signals processing, such as speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012) and time series data analysis (Liu, Chen, Peng, & Wang, 2017).
```

```
CNN-LSTM model uses CNN for feature extraction on input data and LSTM to perform sequence prediction on the feature vectors
```

```
Although LSTM can handle long time series data, it is still an RNN structure, which focuses on time step relationships and lacks extraction of global information.
```

```
Attention mechanism was first proposed in machine translation and then widely used in text classification and representation learning.
```

For the first time, this paper applies the deep learning model of CNN_LSTM combined with the self-attention mechanism in the field of driver stress classification.

Specifically, the **CNN-LSTM** model is used **to extract features from non-invasive multimodal time series data**, and the **self-attention mechanism** is used **to fuse features of eye, vehicle and environment**, and **weigh features from different modalities** to effectively detect drivers' stress levels.
