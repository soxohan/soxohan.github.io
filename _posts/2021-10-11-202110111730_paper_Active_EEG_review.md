~~대체 이 논문을 왤케 늦게 찾은 걸까아,, 굉장히 짧고 굵다. EEG active learning start!~~

## Abstract

- EEG + Active learning
- The goal of this study is to critically review current state-of-the-art of active learning approach for EEG classification by machine learning classifiers, especially artificial neural networks (ANN).

<br>

<br>

## Methods

The main idea of active learning is to let the algorithm itself choose the data from which it learns.

<br>

- The active learning approach appears to be studied on EEG recordings since 2011
- Every active learning scheme should mainly focus on answering these two basic questions
  - What is the strategy for acquiring additional samples for the training set?
    - Query synthesis method : to create a personalized classifier for a single subject, where the amount of raw data is limited
    - Stream based method : suitable for mobile and embedded devices and online process
    - Pool based method : EEG recordings should be classified by the pool-based scenario
  - What is the strategy for query generation (the criteria for decision) from the set of unlabeled samples and their possible inclusion in the training set?
    - Uncertainty sampling strategy
    - Query-by-committee strategy
    - Expected error reduction strategy

*대부분 pool-based의 접근. 개략적인 걸 보기에 좋았음. 3쪽 논문이라 술술 읽히는 편.*
