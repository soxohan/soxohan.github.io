L. Zhou, M. Ye, D. Zhang, C. Zhu, and L. Ji, “Prototype-based multisource domain adaptation,” *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*, 2021, pp. 1-13.

~~오랜만에 랩미팅에서 발표한 논문. 생각보다 이해도 쉽고 잘 써서 참고할 만하다고 생각되었다!~~

<br>

## Goal

- To learn better domain-invariant feature using the prototype to transfer the semantic category information from source domains to target domain
  - Considering misalignments across different source domains
  - To solve the problem that the data from multiple source domains also exist domain shift

<br>

## Methods

- Disentanglement
  - Domain-invariant features are disentangled based on adversarial learning strategy
  - Domain-specific features are extracted based on supervised learning correspondingly
- Reconstruction
  - Reconstructing extracted features by domain-invariant features and domain-specific features
  - Constructing class prototypes for all domains
  - Clustering extracted features using class prototypes

<br>

## Result

- The class prototypes can help the feature extraction network to obtain more compact features
