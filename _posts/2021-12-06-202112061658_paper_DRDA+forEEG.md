## Goal
   Improving the classification performance on a single subject by taking the useful information from multiple subjects
<br>
## Motivations
- Deep neural network may suffer from a severe overfitting problem with limited EEG samples
- EEG signals have large inter-subject variability
<br>

## Methods
- Data description
	- Data set Ⅱa of BCI Competition Ⅳ
		- Containing 22-channel EEG signals from 9 subjects
		- For each subject, 2 sessions of data were collected
	- Data set Ⅱb of BCI Competition Ⅳ
		- Recording 3 bipolar-channel EEG signals from 9 subjects
		- For each subject, 5 sessions data were collected

- Preprocessing
	- Bandpass filtering: Third-order Butterworth bandpass filter (4 ~ 38 Hz)
	- Exponential moving standardization
		- To reduce the non-stationarity and fluctuations

- Network Architecture
	- Feature extractor
		- Splitting the 2-D convolution into two 1-D convolution operations for EEG classification
		- For temporal convolution, a kernel size of 25 is applied to deal with the continuous and extensive series
	- Classifier
		- Considering the conditional distribution inconsistency
		- Utilizing the labeled features from both domains to train a robust classifier
	- Domain discriminator
		- Designing the adversarial learning process with the feature extractor and domain discriminator components 

- Loss function
	- Sum of classification loss, adversarial loss, and center loss

<br>

## Results
- Indicating that convolutional neural network with domain adaptation in an end-to-end paradigm is effective for EEG classification
- Showing that the proposed adversarial loss and the center loss significantly reduces the inter-subject and intra-subject non-stationarity
