## Abstract

- Propose **Domain Consensus Clustering (DCC)**
  - Exploits the **domain consensus knowledge** to discover discriminative clusters on both common 
     samples and private ones
    - The semantic-level consensus among cluster centers is utilized to identify cycle-consistent clusters as common classes
    - Design a novel metric named “domain consensus score” to utilize the sample-level consensus to specify the number of target clusters
  - Tackle **UniDA problem** from a new perspective
    - Allows both domains to own private classes

## Results

- Datasets
  - Office-31
  - Office-Home
  - VisDA
  - DomainNet
- Evaluation
  - ACC : the mean of per-class accuracy over common classes and unknown class
  - HM : the harmonic mean on accuracy of common samples and private ones.
- Backbone
  - ResNet-50 with the backbone pretrained on ImageNet
  - VGGNet as backbone for OSDA task on VisDA
